Akan names are traditional names for the Akan people of Ivory Coast and Ghananians
It is primarily determined by day of the week,month and year a child was born
This helps them reflect with their soul and character
The days often follow a specific pattern eg.,"K"/"Kw" for males and 'A' for females
Hence this is why i came up with the Akan name generator to make things easier and faster in order to know about our souls
