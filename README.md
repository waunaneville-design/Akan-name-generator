Akan names are traditional names for the Akan people of Ivory Coast and Ghananians
It is primarily determined by day of the week,month and year a child was born
This helps them reflect with their soul and character
The days often follow a specific pattern eg.,"K"/"Kw" for males and 'A' for females
Hence this is why i came up with the Akan name generator to make things easier and faster in order to know about our souls
I figured it is good to incorperate technology and traditions
# Akan Name Generator (No JavaScript) 🔧

A simple, accessible guide to using the Akan Name Generator without relying on JavaScript. This README explains how to use the project by reading the day-to-name chart or using server-side / manual lookup instead of client-side scripting as there was no javascript used in this project.

## Quick Start 

- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with → your browser).
- Locate the **Day** and **Gender** inputs on the page and use the built-in chart to find the corresponding Akan name.
- If the UI requires input handling that uses JavaScript, simply consult the Day → Name chart below instead.

> Note: This project contains JavaScript files in the repository. This README intentionally avoids any instructions that depend on client-side JS — it focuses on a JS-free workflow.

## Akan Day-to-Name Chart

> Tip: Names may have regional spelling variants (for example, Kwasi / Kwesi or Afua / Afia).

## How to Use without JavaScript 

- Manual: Use any calendar to determine the weekday of birth, then look up the name in the chart above.
- Server-side: If you want automatic name generation without client-side JS, compute the weekday on the server and render the result into `index.html` or a templated page.
- Static pages: Add the chart or breakdown directly in HTML so users can visually find their name without dynamic behavior.

---

## Accessibility & Usability 

- Use semantic HTML: forms, labels, and a clear table for the chart so screen readers can navigate easily.
- Provide visible focus styles and sufficient color contrast for the chart and inputs.

---

## Files of Interest 

- `index.html` — main UI markup (contains the form and the chart).
- `style.css` — styling and layout rules.
- `methods.js`, `script.js` — present in the repo but not required for a JS-free workflow.
